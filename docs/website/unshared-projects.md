# Unshared projects are no longer visible

**Updated November 12, 2022.** Unshared projects can no longer be opened on TurboWarp, forkphorus, and other third-party sites due to changes to the Scratch API.

This page answers most of the questions people have. Please read it in full before discussing these changes with other people to avoid misinformation.

You've had nearly 6 months notice to update your workflows, so hopefully you've done so by now.

*This page will be updated a lot over the next few days.*

:::warning
ANY website other than scratch.mit.edu that asks for your Scratch password is a SCAM, even if it supposedly lets you share your unshared projects with other users. You WILL have your account stolen and projects deleted. There are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule.
